Dendron is the greek word for tree. It's a reference to the hierarchal note taking that Dendron(3) enables.\n2. Dendron is another word for [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) which is an extension of the nerve cell that sends and receives signals in the brain. Think of Dendron(3) as a digital nervous system that helps you consolidate all the information that you care about in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\n3. Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you build, organize, and share knowledge bases of any size.\n\n## How do I get started?\n\n1. Launch the _command bar_ inside vscode:\n    - Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n    - macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`\n    - Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n2. Paste the following command and press `Enter`:\n\n```bash\n> Dendron: Initialize Workspace\n```\n\n![Initialize workspace](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/dendron-init.gif)\n\nWhen the workspace opens, it will show dialogue to install additional recommended extensions.\n","url":"https://github.com/hydrosquall/dendron-tutorial/notes/05774b2e-ebf7-4bbc-8171-ad191ba0ae0a.html","relUrl":"notes/05774b2e-ebf7-4bbc-8171-ad191ba0ae0a.html"},{"doc":"Shortcuts","title":"Shortcuts","hpath":"dendron.shortcuts","content":"\n- `cmd` + `l`: Open lookup bar / notes creation\n\n## Onboarding note details\n\n- ID hashes map to UR\\Ls, which let you rearrange hierarchy freely\n- You can go to backlinks, they show up on hover\n  -

Context menu for any others you may have forgotten\n- Learn shortcut for creating snippets, e.g. for weekly recap emails\n\n### Editing\n\n- opt up/down to shuffle lines and blocks, esp if reprioritizing stuff\n- Deletion for unwanted note (shift cmd d)\n\n\n### Creation\n\n- Copy reference to notes to embed elsewhere\n  - ctrl shift r (remapped to avoid collision)\n- Create new scratch note with no home:\n  - cmd shift s\n\n\n## Top level concepts\n\n- You don't need to worry about the order of files at creation time: write everything now, assign categories later.\n- Applying some hierarchy is needed for high note volume\n- Refactor hierarchy to restructure as needed\n  - Example: move python.md top level to lang.python.\n  - When context switching: now copy/outline mental model from Python to Ruby, and now you can translate each example as needed!\n  - You can search with wildcards in hierarchy, like `lang.*.data` to search across languages\n  - Use this as a cache of solutions to programming problems he runs into\n    - Me: link to markdown bash issue\n\n\n### Inline References\n\n- You can reference other notes, including sections\n((ref: [[dendron.onboarding]]#navigation:#creation))\n\n\n\n### Snippets\n\ndendron. etc keyboard expand\n\n## Onboarding note details\n\n- ID hashes map to URLs, which let you rearrange hierarchy freely\n- You can go to backlinks, fulltext appears inside of hover\n  - [[dendron]] takes you to the workspace root\n  - Goto definition mapped to `cmd` + `enter`\n  - If you navigate to a file that doesn't exist yet, dendron will create it.\n- Tree view appears in Dendron \"backlinks\" and \"tree view\" sections.\n\n### Example task list\n\n- Create initial task list\n- Break into smaller chunks using \"scratch\" nodes, and clean up on demand\n\nYou can create todos, clicking box in preview modifies the MD file.\n\n- [x] Intro (Link to a scratch note) [[scratch.2021.01.01.115340]]\n- [ ] Refactor, etc\n\n### Advantage to developing in VScode\n\n- Using \"screencast mode\" in VSCode: shows what keyboard items you're pressing, helps people who are learning keyboart shortcuts\n- Shuffling line order: (keyboard shortcut)\n\n### Paste images\n\n- Paste image command: take picture from clipboard for adding media readily, saves it to your repository.\n\n### Vscode inline tags\n\n- Use #star or other tags to find related items on the same page when doing search,\n  - use vscode scoped by \"day\" to find all journal entries with matching lines\n\n### Typechecking hierarchy\n\n- https://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html\n- lookup or create\n  - `shift + cmd + l`: add lang file\n  - In video, the error was the template was listed as a list rather than a key\n- When done, reload your index\n\n### Publishing\n\n- Manually specify which hierarchies to publish (private etc)\n- Use pods to export to Github\n","url":"https://github.com/hydrosquall/dendron-tutorial/notes/574c93ab-31ca-4579-b6b8-a481b7b4364f.html","relUrl":"notes/574c93ab-31ca-4579-b6b8-a481b7b4364f.html"},{"doc":"Daily","title":"Daily","hpath":"daily","content":"\n","url":"https://github.com/hydrosquall/dendron-tutorial/notes/35b613c8-015c-401d-9811-2372a2fc53d9.html","relUrl":"notes/35b613c8-015c-401d-9811-2372a2fc53d9.html"},{"doc":"Journal","title":"Journal","hpath":"daily.journal","content":"\nFreeform journal note\n","url":"https://github.com/hydrosquall/dendron-tutorial/notes/cd9c844d-451f-4d43-9f59-816806af49f9.html","relUrl":"notes/cd9c844d-451f-4d43-9f59-816806af49f9.html"},{"doc":"2021","title":"2021","hpath":"daily.journal.2021","content":"\n","url":"https://github.com/hydrosquall/dendron-tutorial/notes/2814d183-a1f7-4fbd-925f-4e38a18cddd9.html","relUrl":"notes/2814d183-a1f7-4fbd-925f-4e38a18cddd9.html"},{"doc":"01","title":"01","hpath":"daily.journal.2021.01","content":"\n","url":"https://github.com/hydrosquall/dendron-tutorial/notes/71b4f7c6-f66d-4a37-9e04-1b3bec567728.html","relUrl":"notes/71b4f7c6-f66d-4a37-9e04-1b3bec567728.html"},{"doc":"01","title":"01","hpath":"daily.journal.2021.01.01","content":"\n# Hello Cameron!\n\n## Welcome thread\n\n- Migrating from Onenote: https://dendron.so/notes/f9b4fc21-7613-4c8a-9257-cec4c06b67f9.html#one-note\n\n### On Visualization inside of otes\n\n> Thanks for the onenote pointer!
