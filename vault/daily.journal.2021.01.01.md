# Hello Cameron!

### On Visualization inside of otes

> Thanks for the onenote pointer! My hierarchy changed over time and there was no "refactor hierarchy" command, so I'm keen to evolve something new in my new vault (and maybe port a few key sections in slowly).
> Re node-link diagram visualization: I haven't seen any knowledge graphs navigation tools that I really like. The most robust ones for dealing with the "hairball" situation I've seen are in financial compliance tools or used in academia (e.g. Cytoscape, Gephi). https://kcollective.substack.com/p/exploration-engines has some good ideas for increasing readability
> Re: note visualization generally (inspired by Bret Victor ideas around giving users more context when they read): I'd like to visualize structured entities in my notes in a dedicated way (e.g. dates can go on a calendar or timeline, events can go on a map, people can appear in an org chart or network graph). Currently hacking on some annotation UIs to help with this process:  https://twitter.com/hydrosquall/status/1343625485415305218?s=20
